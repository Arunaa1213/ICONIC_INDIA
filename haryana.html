          <h3><b>History of Haryana</b></h3>
          <br><br><br><p>Haryana, state in north-central India. It is bounded on the northwest by the state of Punjab and the union territory of Chandigarh, on the north and northeast by the states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, on the east by the state of Uttar Pradesh and the union territory of Delhi, and on the south and southwest by the state of Rajasthan. </p>
          <br><br><br><p>The city of Chandigarh, within the Chandigarh union territory, serves as the capital of not only that territory but also of the states of Haryana and Punjab.</p>
          <br><br><br><p>Haryana was constituted on November 1, 1966, as a result of the partition of the former state of Punjab into two separate states—Punjabi-speaking Punjab and Hindi-speaking Haryana.</p>

          <h3><b>CULTURES</b></h3>
          <p>
            <br><br><br><p>Haryana’s cultural life reflects both the seasonal rhythm of its agricultural economy and a treasure of traditions and legends with roots in ancient India. The boisterous spring festival of Holi is celebrated by people showering coloured powder (or coloured powder mixed with water) on each other, irrespective of age or social status.</p>
            <img src="haryanaplace.jfif" width=500px>
            <br><br><br><p> Janmasthami, the birthday of Krishna (an incarnation of the god Vishnu), is of special religious importance in Haryana because it was on a battlefield at Kurukshetra that Krishna is said to have delivered to the warrior Arjuna the teachings contained in the Bhagavadgita (a part of the epic known as the Mahabharata). </p>
            <br><br><br><p> Festivals in honour of other deities and saints are also an important element of the state’s cultural life, as are cattle fairs, which are held at a number of locations.</p>
