          <h3><b>History of Orissa</b></h3>
          <br><br><br><p>Odisha, formerly called Orissa, state of India. Located in the northeastern part of the country, it is bounded by the states of Jharkhand and West Bengal to the north and northeast, by the Bay of Bengal to the east, and by the states of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to the south and Chhattisgarh to the west. </p>
          <br><br><br><p>Before India became independent in 1947, Odisha’s capital was at Cuttack. The present capitol was subsequently built at Bhubaneshwar, in the vicinity of the city’s historic temples in the east-central coastal plains. In late 2011 the state’s name was officially changed from Orissa to Odisha. Area 60,119 square miles (155,707 square km). Pop. (2011) 41,947,358.</p>
          <br><br><br><p>Odisha’s geologic formations vary considerably in both age and character. In the interior regions, extending across the stable landmass of the Indian subcontinent (a fragment of the ancient supercontinent Gondwana), are found some of the oldest rocks of Earth’s crust</p>

          <p>
            <br><br><br><p>Odisha has a rich artistic heritage and has produced some of the finest examples of Indian art and architecture. Among the most-notable traditions in the visual arts are mural painting, stone carving, wood carving, icon painting (known as patta), and painting on palm leaves.</p>

            <br><br><br><p>In tribal areas Odisha has a wide variety of dances. Music of the madal (a type of local drum) and flute is characteristic of the countryside. The classical dance of Odisha, known as odissi, has survived for more than 700 years.</p>
            <br><br><br><p>Chhau, a type of masked dance associated with the Mayurbhanj district and adjacent areas in the north, is emblematic of Odia culture.</p>
