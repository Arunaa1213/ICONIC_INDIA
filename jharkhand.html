          <h3><b>History of Jharkhand</b></h3>
          <br><br><br><p>Jharkhand, state of India, located in the northeastern part of the country. Jharkhand is bordered by the states of Bihar to the north, West Bengal to the east, Odisha to the south, Chhattisgarh to the west, and Uttar Pradesh to the northwest. Its capital is Ranchi.</p>
          <br><br><br><p>Jharkhand, one of India’s newest states, was carved out of the southern portion of Bihar in 2000. Statehood was the culmination of a long struggle carried on primarily by the Adivasis, or Scheduled Tribes (an official term applied primarily to indigenous communities that fall outside the predominant Indian caste hierarchy).</p>
          <br><br><br><p>Indian independence brought relatively little socioeconomic benefit to the people of the Jharkhand area, which led to widespread discontent with the Bihar administration, particularly among the tribal peoples. </p>

          <br><br><br><h3><b>CULTURES</b></h3>
          <p>
            <br><br><br><p>Many of the villages of the various tribal peoples share some common characteristics. Most settlements have a community dance floor that springs to life during festive times. Among the most widely recognized of Jharkhand’s dances is chhau, an elaborate masked dance of the southeastern region, particularly the Saraikela and East Singhbhum districts.</p>
            <br><br><br><img src="j.jfif" width=500px>
            <br><br><br><p>Although once a village tradition associated with Chaitra Parva, a festival held every April in honour of the god Shiva, chhau eventually received royal patronage and then state sponsorship; it has since become a virtual emblem of the region. </p>
            <br><br><br><p> Other tribal celebrations that provide occasions for music and dancing include the festival of flowers known as Sarhul (or Baha), a cattle festival called Sohrai, and a postharvest festival called Mage Parab.</p>
