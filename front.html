          India is a land of ancient civilizations. India's social, economic,
          and cultural configurations are the products of a long process of
          regional expansion. Indian history begins with the birth of the Indus
          Valley Civilization and the coming of the Aryans. These two phases are
          usually described as the pre-Vedic and Vedic age. Hinduism arose in
          the Vedic period. The fifth-century saw the unification of India under
          Ashoka, who had converted to Buddhism, and it is in his reign that
          Buddhism spread in many parts of Asia. In the eighth century, Islam
          came to India for the first time and by the eleventh century had
          firmly established itself in India as a political force. It resulted
          in the formation of the Delhi Sultanate, which was finally succeeded
          by the Mughal Empire, under which India once again achieved a large
          measure of political unity. It was in the 17th century that the
          Europeans came to India. This coincided with the disintegration of the
          Mughal Empire, paving the way for regional states. In the contest for
          supremacy, the English emerged 'victors'. The Rebellion of 1857-58,
          which sought to restore Indian supremacy, was crushed; and with the
          subsequent crowning of Victoria as Empress of India, the incorporation
          of India into the empire was complete. It was followed by India's
          struggle for independence, which we got in the year 1947.
        </p>
        Here is a brief timeline about the history of India:
        <p>
          <b>Ancient India History</b> The History of India begins with the
          Indus Valley Civilization and the coming of the Aryans. These two
          phases are generally described as the pre-Vedic and Vedic periods. The
          earliest literary source that sheds light on India's past is the Rig
          Veda. It is difficult to date this work with any accuracy on the basis
          of tradition and ambiguous astronomical information contained in the
          hymns. Indus valley civilization, which flourished between 2800 BC and
          1800 BC, had an advanced and flourishing economic system. The Indus
          valley people practiced agriculture, domesticated animals, made tools
          and weapons from copper, bronze, and tin and even traded with some
          Middle East countries.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> The Indus Valley Civilization</b><br />A long time ago, in the
          eastern world, there rose a few civilizations. The main reasons for
          the rise of these urban civilizations were access to rivers, which
          served various functions of human beings. Along with the Mesopotamian
          civilization and the Egyptian civilization, rose the Indus Valley
          civilization spanning Northwest India and modern-day Pakistan. The
          largest amongst the three civilizations, the Indus Valley civilization
          flourished around 2600 BC, at which time agriculture in India started
          flourishing. The fertile Indus valley made it possible for agriculture
          to be carried out on a large scale. The most well-known towns of the
          Indus Valley in today’s date are Mohenjo Daro and Harappa. Unearthing
          these two towns showed excavators glimpses into the richness of the
          Indus Valley civilization, evidenced in ruins and things like
          household articles, war weapons, gold and silver ornament - and so on.
          The people of the Indus Valley civilization lived in well-planned
          towns and well-designed houses made of baked bricks. In an era of
          developments and prosperity, civilization, unfortunately, came to an
          end by around 1300 BC, mainly due to natural calamities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Vedic Civilization</b><br />
          The next era that India saw was that of the Vedic civilization,
          flourishing along the river Saraswati, named after the Vedas, which
          depict the early literature of the Hindus. The two greatest epics of
          this period were the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, still held in great
          reverence by the followers of Hinduism.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Buddhist Era</b><br />
          Next came the Buddhist era, during the time of the Mahajanapadas which
          were the sixteen great powers, during the 7th and the 6th centuries
          BC. Prominent powers at the time were the Sakyas of Kapilavastu and
          the Licchavis of Vaishali. Buddha, whose original name was Siddhartha
          Gautam, was born in Lumbini near Kapilavastu and was the founder of
          Buddhism - a religion based on spiritualism. He died at the age of 80
          in 480 BC but his teachings spread throughout southern and eastern
          Asia and are followed across the world today.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> The Invasion of Alexander</b> When Alexander invaded India in 326
          BC, he crossed the Indus river and defeated the Indian rulers in
          battle. Noteworthy of the Indians’ attempts at war, was the use of
          elephants, something that the Macedonians had never seen before.
          Alexander then took over the lands of the defeated kings.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> The Gupta Dynasty</b> The Gupta period has been referred to as the
          Golden Age of Indian history. When Chandragupt I received the gift of
          Pataliputra in dowry when he married the daughter of the chief of the
          ‘Licchavis’, he started to lay down the foundation of his empire,
          which extended from the river Ganges or the Ganga to the city of
          Allahabad. He ruled for 15 years and was also referred to as the ‘king
          of kings’ for his strategic conquests and the flourishing state of
          India.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Harshavardhana</b><br />
          The last of the ancient kingdoms in India was by the king
          Harshavardhana, who ascended the throne at Thanneshwar and Kannauj
          after his brother died. While successful in a few of his conquests, he
          eventually got defeated by the Chalukya Kingdom of Deccan India.
          Harshavardhana was well-known for establishing relations with the
          Chinese, and also for having high religious tolerance and strong
          administrative capabilities.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Medieval Indian History </b>The medieval history of India is
          renowned for deriving a lot of its character from Islamic kingdoms.
          Extending across almost three generations, medieval India included a
          number of kingdoms and dynasties: - The Chalukyas - The Pallavas - The
          Pandyas - The Rashtrakutas - The Cholas<br />
          The Cholas were the most important rulers at this time, the 9th
          Century AD. Their kingdom covered a large part of South India,
          including Sri Lanka and the Maldives. While the rulers ruled bravely
          and carried out the annexation of multiple territories in India, the
          empire came to an end in the 14th Century AD with an invasion by a man
          named Kafur Malik. The monuments from the Chola Dynasty are still
          intact and are known for their rustic charm. <br />The next major
          empire was that of the Mughals, preceded by a rise in Islamic rulers.
          The invasion of Timur was a significant point in Indian history before
          a Hindu revival movement called the Bhakti movement, came to be.
          Finally, in the 16th Century, the Mughal empire started to rise. One
          of the greatest empires of India, the Mughal empire was a rich and
          glorious one, with the whole of India united and ruled by one monarch.
          The Mughal Kings were Babar, Humayun, Sher Shah Suri (not a Mughal
          king), Akbar, Jehangir, Shah Jahan, and Aurangzeb. They were
          responsible for setting up efficient public administration, laying out
          infrastructure, and promoting the arts. A large number of monuments in
          India today exist from the Mughal period. The death of the last Mughal
          King, Aurangzeb, sowed the seeds of disintegration within India.
          Influencers of Islamic architecture in India, the Mughal kings are
          still looked back in awe.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Akbar</b> Emperor Akbar, also known as Akbar the Great or
          Jalaluddin Muhammad Akbar, was the third emperor of the Mughal Empire,
          after Babur and Humayun. He was the son of Nasiruddin Humayun and
          succeeded him as the emperor in the year 1556 when he was only 13
          years old.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Shah Jahan</b> Shah Jahan, also known as Shahbuddin Mohammed Shah
          Jahan, was a Mughal Emperor who ruled in the Indian Subcontinent from
          1628 to 1658. He was the fifth Mughal ruler, after Babur, Humayun,
          Akbar, and Jahangir. Shah Jahan succeeded the throne after revolting
          against his father, Jahangir.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Chhatrapati Shivaji</b><br />
          Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire in
          western India. He is considered to be one of the greatest warriors of
          his time and even today, stories of his exploits are narrated as a
          part of the folklore. King Shivaji used the guerrilla tactics to
          capture a part of, the then, dominant Mughal empire.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b> Modern Indian History </b>During the late 16th and the 17th
          Centuries, the European trading companies in India competed with each
          other ferociously. By the last quarter of the 18th Century, the
          English had outdone all others and established themselves as the
          dominant power in India. The British administered India for a period
          of about two centuries and brought about revolutionary changes in the
          social, political and economic life of the country.<br />
          However, the zenith of colonisation was achieved when the British
          arrived in the early 1600s as traders. Capitalizing on the
          disintegration that existed in India after the Mughal rule, the
          British actively used the strategy of ‘divide-and-rule’ to rule over
          India for over 2 centuries. While the British had come in earlier,
          they only achieved political power in 1757 AD after the Battle of
          Plassey.<br />
          They took a keen interest in the resources that India had to offered
          and have been looked back at as plunderers of India’s wealth of
          resources - as they took cotton, spices, silk, and tea, amongst
          numerous other resources. While they did lay out a massive chunk of
          India’s infrastructure, by also bringing the Indians steam engines, it
          is seldom looked back at as an equal relationship. The British Raj was
          divisive and pit Indians against one another, on the basis of
          religion; and also mistreated the laborers. The Indians were
          essentially slaves of the British rule and were working hard without
          any returns on their work. This, naturally, led to multiple mutinies;
          and prominent freedom fighters came to the forefront. Different
          ideologies of thought believed that there were different ways of
          gaining freedom; however, they all had one common goal - freedom.<br />
          The British queen had asserted that the aim of the British was to help
          India progress - however, multiple problems arose without the
          consultation of Indian leaders. One important instance of this was
          when in the First World War, Britain launched an attack on Germany on
          behalf of India, even though India did not wish for that to happen;
          and millions of Indian soldiers were at the forefront of the British
          Indian Army during both the world wars - further fuelling the Indian
          resistance. Over a million Indian soldiers were killed in both the
          World Wars.
