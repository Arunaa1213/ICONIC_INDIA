            <p>A small state on India's western coast, Goa has always benefitted as a trade centre because of its easily accessible ports. With a beautiful harmonization of the East and West, Goans have taken the best of both worlds.</p>

            <br><br><br><p>Following their age-old traditions and customs, Goan's celebrate all major festivals with fervour without bringing any religious barriers within the society.</p>
            <br><br><br><p>In an area where tourism is the core economy booster, small handicrafts and souvenir jewellery are popular items found in the local markets. Skilled artisans reuse shells and coconut skins found on the beach to make stunning jewellery, frames, and showpieces for home decor.</p>

            <p>Any average day feels like a festival in Delhi. Like any festival, the city is chaotic. It’s loud. And you’re very likely to get stuck in traffic.</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Goa Carnival</b><p>The days are marked by colourful and musical parades which begin in the capital Panaji and travel throughout the state making it one of the most popular festivals of Goa. </p></li>
              <li><b>Christmas</b><p>Known for its excellent beaches and legendary nightlife, perhaps Goa is the best place to celebrate Christmas in India. With its Portuguese legacy and Catholic population, Christmas in Goa is celebrated with a gripping fervour.</p></li>
              <li><b>New Year Eve in Goa</b><p>Goa is known for its famously lavish New Year's celebrations. The best part, of course, is the night of New Year when the whole party-state stops their thumping Bass and Trance filled music just to count down with the clock to strike the midnight 12.</p></li>
              <li><b>Feast of Saint Francis Xavier</b><p>This renowned festival in Goa is carried out to honour the death of Saint Xavier, popularly known as 'Goencho Saib' (Lord of Goa) by locals</p></li>
