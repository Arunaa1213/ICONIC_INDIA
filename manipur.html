          <h3><b>History of Manipur</b></h3>
          <p>Manipur, state of India, located in the northeastern part of the country. It is bordered by the Indian states of Nagaland to the north, Assam to the west, and Mizoram to the southwest and by Myanmar (Burma) to the south and east.</p>
          <p>ike other northeastern states, it is largely isolated from the rest of India. The name Manipur means “land of gems.” Its economy centres on agriculture and forestry, and trade and cottage industries also are important.</p>
          <p>The state has two major physiographic regions: the Manipur River valley and a large surrounding tract of mountainous country. </p>

          <h3><b>CULTURES</b></h3>
          <p>
            <p>Polo and field hockey are popular sports. Manipur has given birth to an indigenous form of classical dance known as manipuri.</p>

            <p>Unlike other Indian dance forms, hand movements are used decoratively rather than as pantomime, bells are not accentuated, and both men and women perform communally. The dance dramas, interpreted by a narrator, are a part of religious life.  </p>
            <p>Themes are generally taken from the life of Krishna, the pastoral god of Hinduism. Long an isolated art form, manipuri was introduced to the rest of India by the poet Rabindranath Tagore in 1917.</p>
