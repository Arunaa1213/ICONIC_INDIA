Telangana was a region within Andhra Pradesh for almost six decades, but in 2014 it was carved off to form a separate state.<br><br><br> The capital of both Andhra Pradesh and Telangana is Hyderabad, in west-central Telangana.The state draws its name from the Andhra people, who have inhabited the area since antiquity and developed their own language, Telugu.<br><br><br> Andhra Pradesh came into existence in its present form in 1956 as a result of the demand of the Andhras for a separate state.<br><br><br> Although it is primarily agricultural, the state has some mining activity and a significant amount of industry.<br><br><br> Area 106,204 square miles (275,068 square km). Pop. (2011) 84,665,533.<br><br><br><br>          
            <br><b>post-independence of India</b> <br>The Nizams of Hyderabad have retained the city's independence without merging it with the country.<br><br><br> After a wide range of consultations from Indian leaders to which Nizams had not obliged, the Indian government has forced it to merge in India thus forming Hyderabad state (which is now Telangana).<br><br><br> Later, the Government of India has merged Hyderabad with Andhra on the proposal of Andhra leaders making a way for Andhra Pradesh state as part of the linguistic state on November 1, 1956.<br><br><br> Since then the Andhra Pradesh state has been celebrating the state formation day on November 1.<br><br><br><br>Historians believe that the original people of Andhra Pradesh were Aryans.<br><br><br> They migrated to the south of Vindhyas and there they mixed up with other races.<br><br><br> A major part of Emperor Ashoka's kingdom, Andhra Pradesh was an important Buddhist center of that time.<br><br><br> Several places in the state still bears the traces of the Buddhist culture and influence.

            <br><br><br><p>The Andhras’ contribution to India’s cultural heritage is substantial. 
              <br><br><br><b>Architecture and painting</b> have been highly developed arts in the region since ancient times.<br> 
              <br><br><br><img src="kuchipudi.jfif" width="200px"><br>The <b>kuchipudi style</b> of dance is unique in the Indian tradition, while Karnatak (South Indian) music has derived much from Andhra roots. 
              <br><br><br>Many of southern India’s major composers of classical Indian music have been Andhras, and Telugu has been the language of most of the compositions.<br> <b>Telugu</b>, one of the four literary languages of the Dravidian family, occupies a prestigious place among Indian languages, being renowned for its antiquity and admired by many for its mellifluous quality.<br> <b>Telugu literature</b> was prominent in the Indian literary renaissance of the 19th and 20th centuries, as the writing resonated with a revolution in literary forms and expression, stimulated to a large degree by Western genres. Andhra Pradesh has many periodicals in English, Telugu, and Urdu. Muslim culture in the Telangana region further enriches the state’s cultural diversity.</p>
          </p>
          <br><br><br><p>
            Before Indian independence, arts and literature thrived mostly under the sponsorship of royal patrons and private organizations, many of which still function. Since independence, the state has created autonomous academies to revive, popularize, and promote fine arts, dance, drama, music, and literature.<br><br><br> The conscious cultivation of cultural expression is more an urban than a rural phenomenon, for cultural performances, literary meetings, and religious discussions occur mostly in towns or cities. <br><br><br>Cultural development in different parts of the state under different historical circumstances resulted in the occurrence of recognizable variations in dialect, in caste structure, and in other traditions, all of which ultimately served to diversify the rural arts. Rural cultural media such as balladry, puppetry, and storytelling are indigenous to the area; use of those media in social and political communication is also common. The penetration of the mass media, especially radio and television, and of Internet access into rural areas helped to bring an awareness of classical traditions to the rural communities and of rural arts to the urban population.
