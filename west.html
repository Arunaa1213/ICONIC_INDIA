          <p>
            <p>Bengalis have long fostered art, literature, music, and drama. The visual arts have, by tradition, been based mainly on clay modeling, terra-cotta work, and decorative painting.</p>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/d5/Chhau_dance.jpg" width=500px>
            <p>The modern period has produced, among others, the Nobel Prize-winning poet Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941), whose contribution still dominates the Indian literary scene.</p>
            <p>Traditional music takes the form of devotional and cultural songs. Rabindra Sangeet, songs written and composed by Tagore, draw on the pure Indian classical as well as traditional folk-music sources, including the Baul singing genre. </p>
