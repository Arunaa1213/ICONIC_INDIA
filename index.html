          <h3>HISTORY</h3>
          <br /><b>India</b> is a country in South Asia whose name comes from the Indus River. The name <i>'Bharata'</i> is used as a designation for the country in their constitution referencing the ancient mythological emperor, Bharata, whose story is told, in part, in the Indian epic Mahabharata.India is a great country where people speak different
          languages but the national language is Hindi. India is full of
          different castes, creeds, religion, and cultures but they live
          together. That’s the reasons India is famous for the common saying of
          <b>“unity in diversity“</b>. India is the seventh-largest country in the
          whole world.
        </p>

        <h3><b>GEOGRAPHY AND CULTURE</b></h3>
        <p id="Geography">
          India has the <b>second-largest population</b> in the world. India is also
          knowns as Bharat, Hindustan and sometimes Aryavart. It is surrounded
          by oceans from three sides which are Bay Of Bengal in the east, the
          Arabian Sea in the west and Indian oceans in the south. Tiger is the

        <h3><b>ARCHAEOLOGY</b></h3>
        <p>Archaeological excavations have discovered artifacts used by early humans, including stone tools, which suggest an extremely early date for human habitation and technology in the area. While the civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt have long been recognized for their celebrated contributions to civilization, India has often been overlooked, especially in the West, though its history and culture is just as rich. The Indus Valley Civilization (c. 7000-c. 600 BCE) was among the greatest of the ancient world, covering more territory than either Egypt or Mesopotamia, and producing an equally vibrant and progressive culture.</p>

        <h3 id="cultures"><b>CULTURES</b></h3>
        <p>Culture plays a pivotal role in the development of any country. A culture of a nation represents its values, goals, practices and shared beliefs. The Indian culture has never been rigid and that's why it is surviving with pride in the modern era. It timely imbibes the qualities of various other cultures and comes out as a contemporary and acceptable tradition. That is what is unique about the Indian culture, it moves on with the time. There are certain things about India that are famous worldwide, like:</p>
        <p><b>Ways of Greetings : </b>India is a land with varied greeting customs. Different religions here have different ways to express their greetings to others. For instance, in major Hindu families <b>"Namaste"</b> is the most common way of greeting the outsiders and elders. Both palms placed together and raised below the face not only show the respect for others but also makes the greeter feel the affection in return. Similarly, Muslims greet by saying <b>"Adab"</b>, which involves raising of right hand towards the face in such a manner that the palm is inwards and is in front of the eyes with the finger tips almost touching the forehead. It is for sure that no 'hello' or 'hi' can create that magic.</p>
        <p><b>Flower Garlands : </b>Indian people are also famous for welcoming with flower garlands. In Indian marriages, the exchange of garlands between the bride and the groom is a ritual in itself. People also offer flower garlands to Gods and Goddesses during their prayers.</p>
        <p><b>Indian Marriages : </b>Time has changed but the lavishness has always been an integral and indispensable part of Indian marriages. In India, marriage is still taken as an institution where not two people but two families get united. So, it always calls for boisterous celebrations full of music and dance. Within India, every caste and community has its own way of performing the rituals of marriage. In Hindu marriages, while Punjabis perform the <b>'Roka'</b> ceremony in weddings, Sindhis perform the 'Berana'. But most common of all is the ritual of Hast Milap ceremony popularly called Paanigrahan Sanskaar.

          Muslims also have their own special way of celebrating the marriage ceremony, popularly called <b>Nikaah</b>. During the auspicious occasion, the groom's family gives mehar (nuptial gift) to the bride. Parsis plant a young mango tree in a pot during the marriage ceremony. This ceremony is famous as <b>'Madhavsaro'</b> ceremony. Every state has its own special way of celebrating the marriage ceremony.</p>

          <h3 id="famousplaces">FAMOUS PLACES</h3>
          <h5><b>1.TAJ MAHAL : </b></h5>
          <figure>
          <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/IND/india-top-attractions-taj-mahal.jpg" width="500">
          <figcaption>Tajmahal</figcaption>
        </figure>
          <p>Perhaps India's most recognizable building, the Taj Mahal is also the world's most famous testimony to the power of love. Named after Mumtaz Mahal, the favorite wife of Emperor Shah Jahan, this most beautiful of mausoleums was begun upon her death in 1631 and took 20,000 workmen until 1648 to complete.The best time to visit is either at dawn or dusk when the atmosphere is brilliantly altered by the change in lighting. If possible, try to catch a view of the Taj Mahal's reflection from the far bank of the Yamuna River-it makes for a memorable (and safe) selfie.

            Address: 64 Taj Road, Agra-282001</p>
            <h5><b>2.Harmandir Sahib: The Golden Temple of Amritsar :</b></h5>
            <figure>
            <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/IND/india-top-attractions-harmandir-sahib.jpg" width="500">
            <figcaption>The Golden Temple of Amritsar</figcaption>
          </figure>
            <p>Founded in 1577 by Ram Das, Amritsar is an important hub of Sikh history and culture. The main attraction here is Harmandir Sahib, opened in 1604 and still often referred to as the Golden Temple for its beautiful gold decoration.

              The holiest of India's many Sikh shrines (it also attracts many Hindus and people of other faiths), the temple was built in a blend of Hindu and Islamic styles. Its lower marble section features such flourishes as ornate inlaid floral and animal motifs, while the large golden dome represents a lotus flower, a symbol of purity to Sikhs.</p>
            <h5><b>3.The Red Fort, New Delhi : </b></h5>
            <figure>
            <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/IND/india-top-attractions-red-fort.jpg" width="500">
            <figcaption>The Red Fort</figcaption>
          </figure>
            <p>Built by Shah Jahan in 1648 as the seat of Mughal power – a role it maintained until 1857 – the magnificent crescent-shaped Red Fort in New Delhi, named after the stunning red sandstone used in its construction, covers a vast area of more than two square kilometers, all of it surrounded by a large moat.

              Highlights include its two largest gates: the impressive Lahore Gate (the fort's main entrance) and the elaborately decorated Delhi Gate, once used by the emperor for ceremonial processions.</p>
            <h5><b>4.Mumbai: The Gateway of India : </b></h5>
            <figure>
            <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/IND/india-top-attractions-gateway-india.jpg" width="500">
            <figcaption>The Gateway of India</figcaption>
          </figure>
            <p>Standing an impressive 26 meters tall and overlooking the Arabian Sea, the iconic Gateway of India is a must-see when in Mumbai. Built to commemorate the arrival of King George V and his wife Queen Mary in 1911, this stunning piece of architecture was opened with much pomp and ceremony in 1924 and was, for a while, the tallest structure in the city.

              Constructed entirely of yellow basalt and concrete and notable for its Indo-Saracenic design, the Gateway of India was also the scene of a rather less jubilant procession of British soldiers in 1948 when India gained its independence. These days, the huge archway provides a stunning backdrop that is as popular among locals as it is tourists</p>
            <h5><b>5.The Holy City of Varanasi :</b></h5>
            <figure>
            <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/IND/india-top-attractions-varanasi.jpg" width="500">
            <figcaption>The Holy City of Varanasi</figcaption>
          </figure>
            <p>Dating back to the 8th century BC, Varanasi is one of the oldest still inhabited cities in the world. A major pilgrimage center for Hindus, this holy city has long been associated with the mighty Ganges River, one of the faith's most important religious symbols.

              Varanasi offers many reasons to visit, not least of them the chance to explore the Old Quarter adjacent to the Ganges where you'll find the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, built in 1780. The New Vishwanath Temple with its seven separate temples is also of interest.
              
              Bathing in the Ganges is of great importance to Hindus, and numerous locations known as "ghats" feature stairways leading to the water where the faithful bathe before prayers. </p>
              <h5><b>6.Mecca Masjid, Hyderabad</b></h5>
              <figure>
              <img src="https://www.planetware.com/photos-large/IND/india-top-attractions-mecca-masjid.jpg" width="500">
              <figcaption>Mecca Masjid</figcaption>
            </figure>
              <p>Construction of Hyderabad's Mecca Masjid, one of the world's largest mosques – and one of the oldest in India – began in 1614 during Mohammed Quli Qutub Shah's reign and took almost 80 years to complete.

                Large enough to accommodate 10,000 worshipers, this beautiful mosque's 15 enormous arches and pillars were each wrought from single slabs of black granite dragged to the site by huge cattle trains reputedly consisting of up to 1,400 bulls.</p>
