          <h3><b>History of madhyapradesh</b></h3>
          <br><br><br><p>Madhya Pradesh, state of India. As its name implies—madhya means “central” and pradesh means “region” or “state”—it is situated in the heart of the country. The state has no coastline and no international frontier.</p>
          <br><br><br><p>It is bounded by the states of Uttar Pradesh to the northeast, Chhattisgarh to the southeast, Maharashtra to the south, Gujarat to the southwest, and Rajasthan to the northwest. The capital is Bhopal, in the west-central part of the state. Area 119,016 square miles (308,252 square km). Pop. (2011) 72,597,565.</p>
          <br><br><br><p>Madhya Pradesh lies over a transitional area between the Indo-Gangetic Plain in the north and the Deccan plateau in the south. Its physiography is characterized by low hills, extensive plateaus, and river valleys.</p>
