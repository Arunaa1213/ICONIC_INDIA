          <h3><b>History of Bihar</b></h3>
          <p>Bihar, state of eastern India. It is bounded by Nepal to the north and by the Indian states of West Bengal to the northeast and Uttar Pradesh to the west.<br><br><br> In November 2000 the new state of Jharkhand was created from Bihar’s southern provinces and now forms the state’s southern and southeastern borders.<br><br><br> The capital of Bihar is Patna.<br><br><br> </p>
          <p>Bihar occupied an important position in the early history of India.<br><br><br> For centuries it was the principal seat of imperial powers and the main focus of Indian culture and civilization.<br><br><br> The derivation of the name Bihar from the Sanskrit vihara (Buddhist monastery) reflects the prominence of such communities in the region in ancient times.<br><br><br> Area 38,301 square miles (99,200 square km). Pop. (2011) 103,804,637.</p>
          <p><br><br><br>he state is naturally divided by the Ganges (Ganga) River into two regions—the North Bihar Plains and the South Bihar Plains, which together form part of the middle Gangetic Plain.<br><br><br> Except for the foothills of the Himalayas in the extreme northwest, the North Bihar Plain is a flat alluvial region, less than 250 feet (75 metres) above sea level and prone to flooding.<br><br><br></p>

          <br><br><br><h3><b>CULTURES</b></h3>
          <p>
            <br><br><br><p>The cultural regions of Bihar show a close affinity with the linguistic regions. Maithili is the language of old Mithila (the area of ancient Videha, now Tirhut), which is dominated by orthodoxy and the Maithil Brahman way of life. Maithili is the only Bihari language with a script of its own, called Tirhuta, and a strong literary history; one of the earliest and most celebrated writers in Maithili was Vidyapati (15th century), noted for his lyrics of love and devotion.</p>

            <br><br><br><p>The Bhojpuri language has hardly any written literature but does have a considerable oral narrative tradition. Magahi too has a rich tradition of oral literature. The North and South Bihar plains also have contributed significantly to contemporary Hindi and Urdu literature.</p>
            <br><br><br><p>Many villages of the Scheduled Tribes have a dancing floor, a sacred grove (sarna) where worship is offered by a village priest, and a bachelor’s dormitory (dhumkuria). The weekly market, hat, plays an important part in the tribal economies. Tribal festivals such as Sarhul, which marks the flowering of the sal trees, and Soharai, celebrated after the rice harvest, are occasions of great festivity.</p>
