          <h3><b>History of Gujarat</b></h3>
          <p>Gujarat, state of India, located on the country’s western coast, on the Arabian Sea. It encompasses the entire Kathiawar Peninsula (Saurashtra) as well as the surrounding area on the mainland.</p>
          <p>The state is bounded primarily by Pakistan to the northwest and by the Indian states of Rajasthan to the north, Madhya Pradesh to the east, and Maharashtra to the southeast. Gujarat also shares a small segment of its southeastern border with the Indian union territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and, together with the Arabian Sea, it surrounds the territory of Daman and Diu.</p>
          <p>The coastline of Gujarat is 992 miles (1,596 km) long, and no part of the state is more than 100 miles (160 km) from the sea. The capital is Gandhinagar, on the outskirts of the north-central city of Ahmadabad (Ahmedabad)—the former capital, the largest city in the state, and one of the most-important textile centres in India.</p>

          <h3><b>CULTURES</b></h3>
          <p>
            <p>Much of the culture of Gujarat reflects the mythology surrounding the Hindu deity Krishna (an incarnation of the god Vishnu), as transmitted in the Puranas, a class of Hindu sacred literature. The older rasnritya and raslila dance traditions honouring Krishna find their contemporary manifestation in the popular dance called garba. </p>

            <p> The dance is performed primarily at the Navratri festival (September–October), which honours the divine feminine; dancers move in a circle, singing and keeping time by clapping their hands.</p>
            <p>Shaivism (Shivaism), the cult of the Hindu god Shiva, has long flourished in Gujarat; so too has Vaishnavism (the worship of Vishnu), from which have emerged not only the cult of bhakti (devotion) but also a rich repertoire of verse and song. </p>
